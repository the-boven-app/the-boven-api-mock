          "description": "Developed since start of 2015. These crags are on the next farm south of Tranquilitas, accessed by a 15 minute easy walk from the Tranquilitas Campsite. Grades range from 10 to 29. Climbing is on compact technical walls and arêtes on amazing quality rock above a valley that is deep and unspoilt. The setting has a ‘wilder’ feel added to by the complete lack of any cellphone signal. Beautiful indigenous trees grow along the base and the crags are quiet except for the sound of the waterfall and the baboons. Climbs are shady earlier than other sectors, most from 9 or 10 onwards except for those at the Animal Farm Sector. The landowner has graciously granted access on the basis that climbers absolutely stick to the following rules: \n\n-ONLY WALK IN BY THE APPROVED ROUTE -KEEP DOGS ON A LEAD AS \nTHERE ARE ANIMALS ON THE FARM -NO FIRES EVER -NO LITTER, \nINCLUDING CIGARETTE BUTTS AND TOILET PAPER -DO NOT WALK IN \nVIEW OF THE FARMHOUSE – DO NOT WALK OUT AFTER DARK…YOU \nMAY BE CONFUSED FOR A THIEF AND SHOT (THIS IS A WORKING FARM) \n",
          "approach": "The walk in has been marked specifically to avoid disturbing the owner, taking a short cut across the hill is absolutely prohibited and actually does not save more than a minute or two. Start at the boom gate close to the toilet block at Tranquilitas campsite, walk along the rough track for 250 metres until it bends sharply to the left and there is a cairn in the grass. Cut across on grassy track 30 metres to a well-worn mountain bike trail, follow this for 230 metres to a large cairn on right and cross grass to obvious place to easily step over the fence (cairns) onto a dirt road. Walk 100 m along the road through wattle trees, when you exit the trees there is a ‘cow skull’ cairn (maybe the cow skull is still there). From here: \n\n-For the Corruption Crags, from the 'cow-skull cairn', head leftish (north east) towards the cliff top. There is a lovely narrow gully (aka 'Narrow Gully') to walk down. From here the climbs are to the right (facing out). There is no real path and the ground is not easy but there looks to be a few good lines. Another option is to abseil into the climbs, either from the chains (which can be reached with care, from the top) or by slinging boulders. \n\n-For the Burning Man Walls from the ‘cow skull’ cairn, head right (south) following cairns and cattle tracks 450 metres up and down to a flat rock with a cairn by a large wattle tree growing on the cliff top. Hiding behind this tree is an easy scramble down, arriving at the east (right) end of the sector. The path along the base is good. \n\n-For the Animal Farm Crags. These are the crags facing NW on the opposite side of the valley (sunny except early morning and evening) Do not walk over the dam wall as we must not walk on top of the cliffs there. Rather, walk in as for Burning Man Walls to end of crag, make your way over the stream just past an old metal pump about 30m down from the falls, through some thorns. Then up to the crags easily enough. \n"

          "description": "The Creche is a crag for someone new to \"outside\" climbing, probably more so than Flying is Fun. Yet there are a few routes particularly in the descent gully and just to its west, that would keep more experienced climbers engaged. It is a great cliff for climbers to take their youngsters or inexperienced friends to start climbing. You will find the bolt spacing here is generally close, similar to Flying Is Fun or Strubens Valley. An attempt has been made to bolt appropriate to the grade, so that someone new to the grade, or with only gym experience, or who may be short and/or young, can lead climb feeling fairly comfortable here, especially on the easier routes. With this in mind it may be appropriate to mention a few guidelines to outside sport climbing.\n\n1. Take 2 or 3 spare draws as nearby bolts may sometimes be clipped to increase comfort (but watch rope drag!) \n2. On the traverse routes extending with a 60cm sling (or 2 draws) may further reduce friction as the rope changes direction too sharply.\n3. Wear on the anchors is much increased by toproping directly on them.  Better practice is to leave quickdraws on the anchors until the last person has climbed.\n4. Abseiling on the anchors/chains (as opposed to lowering off) further reduces anchor wear. This wear has led to premature replacement of anchors.\n5. An efficient (and perhaps safer) way if one plans to climb neighbouring routes, is not to thread the anchors at all. The last climber lowers off the draws on the anchors, and these are collected from the neighbouring climb – assuming the two sets of anchors are close. \n\nThe routes are sometimes fairly close to each other along the cliff. In several places a separate route is described, using a significant portion of another climb. Especially where an easier route can be easily negotiated, say with a different start.  Additional bolts have been added on existing routes, to provide more protection for shorter climbers, esp where easier starts are described. Some additional bolts have been placed BETWEEN routes, to facilitate the traverse routes. \n\nThis proliferation could lead to confusion, so the use of names marked at the start (or even in the middle!) of climbs is greater than at some other areas. Traverse routes may be colour coded, with coloured marks on the bolts. Be alert to the fact that more than 1 colour may appear on a hanger, and that the ink may fade with time. If your route goes more of less straight up, ignore colour marks.\n\nThe Creche is situated at the east end of the Tranquilitas Crag, close to the boundary fence with the neighbouring farm. The safest access for larger groups and dogs is to climb down the other (west) end of Tranquilitas Crag and walk east along the base, somewhat up and down till you find very slabby rock, perhaps 500m to the East. Alternatively walk more easily along the top of the cliff until a point 40m from the boundary fence. Turn left off the cycle track and walk 30m down to the cliff edge. \n\nHere are 2 sets of abseil chains. The western pair are obviously easier to use. There is a steep gully about 30m West of this point. This is now easier/safer to down climb with a knotted rope and Via Ferrata in place. The bottom 3m has metal rungs and Ubolts in place to facilitate downclimbing. It may be better for inexperienced climbers to negotiate this gully for the first time climbing up from the base.\n\nThe first 8 or 9 climbs described below (from L to R) all start at the same place on the left (east) of the slabby area at a large corner with a sheer wall (HUFFING WARTHOG follows the finger crack) to the left.\n",

Walk E along this (or across the veld), branching down to the L before a stony ridge about 200m away. You may see a cairn here.
